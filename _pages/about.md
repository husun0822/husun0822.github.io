My name is Hu Sun. I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Yang Chen](https://yangchenfunstatistics.github.io/yangchen.github.io//). My research interests include: matrix & tensor data model, spatio-temproal process and applications in astrophysics and geophysics data. Outside of academic life, I love Karaoke, playing board/video games and 8-ball pool.

See my publications on my [publications](/publications/) page.
